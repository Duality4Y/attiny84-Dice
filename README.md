# attiny84-Dice

this is a attiny84 dice build.

idea is to have a dice that throws numbers for you on a led "display"

numbers are randomly selected.

the dice has a tilt switch which allows you to throw by shaking the dice.


hardware folder contains a schematic for eagle-cad.

src contains the c source which goes through some numbers,

before deciding on a number.


the assembler source is in the asm folder.

it comes with a assembler binary. (for linux might I add)

``` gavrgasm dice.asm```

find assembler at: http://www.avr-asm-tutorial.net/gavrasm/index_en.html

compiling with scons script as follows:

``` scons ```

and to upload using a programmer predefined in the script (variable programmer)

``` scons upload=1 ```


want to compile for some other mcu ?

look for the mmcu and mcu variables in Sconstruct script.

want to use a different programmer ?

look for the programmer variable in the Sconstruct script.

want to upload to a avr that has the arduino bootloader ?

you can just select 'arduino' for the programmer.
